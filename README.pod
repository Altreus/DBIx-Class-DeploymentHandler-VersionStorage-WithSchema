=head1 DESCRIPTION

The standard DeploymentHandler storage only stores the version of the schema.
This means you can't deploy multiple DH-handled DBIC schemata into the same
database.

This module has an extra column to store the schema that it is deploying as well
as the version.

To use it, you'll have to create a new subclass of
L<DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Dad> that uses this module instead of the
standard one, and instantiate that in your script instead.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This module implements L<DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::HandlesVersionStorage>
and is similar to L<DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::VersionStorage::Standard>.
